# Contributing to Ghostline

Ghostline is built in the open. If you're here, you already pass the vibe check.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repo
2. Pick a module from the roadmap
3. Open an issue to claim it before starting (avoids duplicate work)
4. Submit a PR with tests

## Module Standards

- CLI modules: Python 3.11+ or TypeScript (Node 20+)
- All modules must have a `--json` output flag for pipeline composability
- No telemetry. Ever.
- No third-party analytics. Ever.

## Merch Store

Design contributions welcome — ghost skull variants, terminal humor, dark aesthetic. Open an issue tagged `merch-design`.

## Code of Conduct

Be technically rigorous. Be kind to humans. Don't be a threat actor.
